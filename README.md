# Gold-Price-Prediction

# Introduction
Gold prices are one commodity that is extremely valuable and investment in it may not be as profitable as stocks but can still be a safer option compared to stocks. Goal of this project was to create a machine learning model to predict future gold prices.

# Data
The dataset weâ€™ll use for this python project has been pulled using Quanl API for finance data. Data analysis on the data is presented in the same jupyter notebook and daily closing prices has been used to predict future daily closing prices.

# Algo Selection

LSTM has been used as the algorithm for this project as they are able to store information over a period of time and hence are very good for sequential data like ours.
